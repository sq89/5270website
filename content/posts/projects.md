**Tesla Stock Forecasting feature analysis**, *ORIE 5741 Big Messy Data*, Ithaca, NY  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Aug. 2021 to Dec. 2021

• Extracted Elon Musk’s Twitter content to conduct sentimental analysis and compared with the price trend one day later. <br>

• Conducted logistic regression, neural network and random forest to predict Tesla’s price trend and got an accuracy of 65.5%. 


**Study on Credit Card Fraud Detection Data**, *STAT 432 Basics of Statistical Learning*, Urbana, IL  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; Dec. 2020 to May 2021 <br>

•	Observed the imbalanced proportion in the dataset and used AUC as the proper evaluation metric. 

•	Chose XGBoost model, SMOTE as the sampling method based on the AUC result and tuned the model with the best hyperparameters obtained by searching through their respective bounds. <br>

**Study on Carbon Dioxide Emission**, *STAT 429 Time Series*, Urbana, IL &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; Dec. 2020 to May 2021

• Constructed two regression models with R to predict the atmosphere Carbon Dioxide, and conducted the model diagnosis test such as mean squared errors, AIC, BIC and the Ljung-box plot.

• Developed an ARIMA model based on ACF and PACF test to obtain the data seasonality, and forecasted a 5 month of trend of Carbon Dioxide emission amount.
